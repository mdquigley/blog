Okay, first real post. Here we go.  

Like a whole ton of people, I've thought about starting to blog several times over the years. I've journaled in a physical notebook on and off forever, and have pretty consistently kept a bullet journal for a combination of task and habit tracking, capturing ideas, and shortlength journaling. I've also written privately in longer form digital documents, which I do find helpful. I think having something be publicly available might force me to A) write more concisely and B) write more often(?).  

I don't think everything warrants sharing online, and I value private writing. But I figure this can serve as a means to bump up my communication skills while tracking various tech-related projects, and maybe some art. I'm constantly flipping between art practice and fiddling with technology. I hope this might help to improve my follow through, potentially in both areas but I will likely start with the technology side of things since that's potentially easier to remember to document while you're working on the same device. Often my art practice takes place in my dirt & brick floored basement specifically to take a break from digital screens.  

So as a start I set this up with *[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)* and am hanging it off my of artist website, which is hosted via *[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)*. It's using the *[cactus](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-cactus)* theme which some basic css edits and my own favicon & header icon to match my main site. 

We'll see how this goes. Maybe I'll just talk to myself. In which case, thanks for setting this up.
