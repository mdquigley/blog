**Funch** was my final project for Computer Music Synthesis with Professor Peter McCulloch. It is a max patch capable of processing both live audio and sound files. It consists of four main sections, each dedicated to the predominant max object in that portion of the patch. The user can manipulate various parameters affecting sample and bit rates, ring modulation, delay and resonance. Each unit output can be mixed independently and a recording of the master output can be made. The patch is intended as a performance application with opportunities for collaboration between patch operator and live performer or prerecorded sound sources.
