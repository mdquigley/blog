Final project for Java Music Systems with Professor Nick Didkovsky, Zone Out is a Java program that creates generative ambient music for three voices, written with Java Music Specification Language and JSyn. Above is an excerpt recording. It was originally hosted as a Java applet on a personal website. I'd like to recreate and expand on this idea with JavaScript using Tone.js as a personal project sometime soon.
