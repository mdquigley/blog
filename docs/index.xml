      <description>Final project for Java Music Systems with Professor Nick Didkovsky, Zone Out is a Java program that creates generative ambient music for three voices, written with JMSL and JSyn. Above is an excerpt recording. It was originally hosted as a Java applet on a personal website. I plan to recreate and expand on this idea with JavaScript using Tone.js as a personal project sometime soon.</description>

      <description>Funch was my final project for Computer Music Synthesis with Professor Peter McCulloch. It is a max patch capable of processing both live audio and sound files. It consists of four main sections, each dedicated to the predominant max object in that portion of the patch. The user can manipulate various parameters affecting sample and bit rates, ring modulation, delay and resonance. Each unit output can be mixed independently and a recording of the master output can be made.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve kept a home server in various configurations over the last several years. Back in April, with an abundance of time at home due to the pandemic, I migrated my server from a old Dell tower running Ubuntu Server to a Raspberry Pi 4 that I had bought a while back and let sit on the shelf. That was fun to tool around with Raspbian and set it up for local network backups and media streaming.</description>

      <description>Okay, first real post. Here we go.
Like a whole ton of people, I&amp;rsquo;ve thought about starting to blog several times over the years. I&amp;rsquo;ve journaled in a physical notebook on and off forever, and have pretty consistently kept a bullet journal for a combination of task and habit tracking, capturing ideas, and shortlength journaling. I&amp;rsquo;ve also written privately in longer form digital documents, which I do find helpful. I think having something be publicly available might force me to A) write more concisely and B) write more often(?</description>
