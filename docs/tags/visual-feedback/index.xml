      <description>Over time instrumentalists come to understand the distinctions between primary physical actions that produce sound and ancillary actions that aid in expressing musical or emotional information, which can be vital to audience understanding. It is possible that the loss of haptic feedback makes the properties of a musical instrument less understandable to both performer and audience. Perhaps then visual feedback can allow an instrumentalist to better understand the limitations of his or her instrument when no such haptic feedback exists, as is the case with many musical systems that incorporate live video interaction.</description>
