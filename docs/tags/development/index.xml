      <description>Goal In this post, we&amp;rsquo;re going to look at deploying a Phaser game with Webpack and GitHub Pages. You&amp;rsquo;ll need a game already made, even if it&amp;rsquo;s super bare bones. Phaser has decent tutorials. I&amp;rsquo;d also recommend the Phaser 3 Project Template.
Setup I recently worked up a simple browser-based JavaScript game using the Phaser 3 and Tone.js frameworks. I called it &amp;ldquo;Get To The Gig&amp;rdquo; and wrote about it here.</description>

About I wanted to build a game that utilized music in an interactive way, and in which the music itself was composed via code as oppposed to only playing back audio files. I thought of a quest style game in which the player picks up instruments and a corresponding musical layer is added to the soundtrack.</description>
