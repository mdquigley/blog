About I wanted to build a game that utilized music in an interactive way, and in which the music itself was composed via code as oppposed to only playing back audio files. I thought of a quest style game in which the player picks up instruments and a corresponding musical layer is added to the soundtrack.</description>

      <description>Overview Toneblocks is a web-based musical creative coding environment, built with Tone.js and Blockly. Originally developed as my thesis project for the Master of Music in Music Technology requirements at NYU Steinhardt. It is the basis for a paper/poster/video presentated at NIME 2021 titled Toneblocks: block-based musical programming, co-authored with Willie Payne. Watch a brief video demonstration on Youtube, or play around with it on my site.
This is Part 1 of several posts taking a closer look at the application and its underlying mechanics.</description>
