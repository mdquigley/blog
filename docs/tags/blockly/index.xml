      <description>Overview Toneblocks is a web-based musical creative coding environment, built with Tone.js and Blockly. Originally developed as my thesis project for the Master of Music in Music Technology requirements at NYU Steinhardt. It is the basis for a paper/poster/video presentated at NIME 2021 titled Toneblocks: block-based musical programming, co-authored with Willie Payne. Watch a brief video demonstration on Youtube, or play around with it on my site.
This is Part 1 of several posts taking a closer look at the application and its underlying mechanics.</description>
