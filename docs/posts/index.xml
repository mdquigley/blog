      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve kept a home server in various configurations over the last several years. Back in April, with an abundance of time at home due to the pandemic, I migrated my server from a old Dell tower running Ubuntu Server to a Raspberry Pi 4 that I had bought a while back and let sit on the shelf.

Like a whole ton of people, I&amp;rsquo;ve thought about starting to blog several times over the years. I&amp;rsquo;ve journaled in a physical notebook on and off forever, and have pretty consistently kept a bullet journal for a combination of task and habit tracking, capturing ideas, and shortlength journaling. I&amp;rsquo;ve also written privately in longer form digital documents, which I do find helpful. I think having something be publicly available might force me to A) write more concisely and B) write more often(?</description>
